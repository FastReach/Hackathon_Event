# Hackathon_Event

We made our website on top of a pre-existing website made by one of our member. The particular website had a lot of useful animations that were integrated into our website.
We went through a lot of brand/shoes names and had to make changes at the last moment. Therefore some files have names of our past files. Changing those will be a long process, so we decided to let them be. Our most recent change was changing all brand names.
We had at first used non-copyright brands. But later changed them to actual brands (to incorporate logos).
For our website, we tried to make it look as realistic as possible.
Using poppy colors and slow animations, we made sure our website was easy on the eyes, while at the same time, making it clear to the user that the purpose of our website, i.e., a sneaker store.
We looked at several real online sneaker stores to get inspiration.
To say that we didn't didn't get some ideas regarding the creative aspects from the other websites would be a lie. A lot of them can be seen integrated in our website.
Our main aim was to capture the user's eyes and we feel like we've achieved that.
